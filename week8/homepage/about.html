                    I came to Mersin from Adıyaman in 1959 with my father. I was 9 years old then. I started my life at that age and started working at a young age by selling water and soda in cinemas. Then I started an apprenticeship in a butcher shop. My master was sending liver and meat to kebab restaurants with me. Every time I went, the kebab restaurant owner's children were getting ready to go to the cinema. My heart was broken. The cinema was a daytime matinee. I always thought if I had a job like this and went to the movies with my friends. Finally, one day, my dream came true and I started selling liver kebabs with a mobile car.
                        The year is 1967… I worked with a mobile car for 12 years. In 1979, I got my first store of 20 square meters. As a result of my work and determination, I opened 4 branches in Mersin. Thanks to our quality service and customer satisfaction, our reputation has spread beyond the province. I opened our first branch in Ankara with a capacity of 300 people. I trained around 500 masters and journeymen. They opened liver shops in different provinces and districts of the country and started to work. That's why, on the one hand, to be worthy of the trust of our esteemed guests by providing quality service, and on the other hand, opening a door of bread to many people, which you appreciate made me even more happy. If we, as Cigerci Apo, are still able to continue our activities today, we owe it to you, our esteemed people.
